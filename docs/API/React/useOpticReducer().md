# useOpticReducer(optic, reducer): [value, dispatch]

```tsx
function useOpticReducer<T, TOpticType, Action>(
  onState: Optic<T, TOpticType>,
  reducer: (state: T, action: Action, onState: Optic<T, total, T>) => T
): [T, Dispatch<Action>];
```

This hook allows you to manage the slice of store focused on by the optic with a reducer.
As arguments it takes an optic and a reducer function while it returns the focused value as well as a dispatch function.

It works pretty much just like React `useReducer`, you use the dispatch function to send actions that the reducer will use to compute the next state.  
The only difference is that you can use a reducer that takes a pure optic as third argument. With it you can derive new optics to handle immutable updates inside of the reducer with the `get` and `set` methods.

### Example:

```tsx
import { createState, useReducer } from "@optics/react";

const initialCounter = { value: 0, step: 1 };
const onCounter = createState(initialCounter);

const reducer = (state, action, onState) => {
  const onValue = onState.value;
  const onStep = onState.step;
  switch (action.type) {
    case "increment":
      // equivalent to: return { ...state, value: state.value + state.step };
      return onValue.set((prev) => prev + state.step, state);
    case "decrement":
      return onValue.set((prev) => prev - state.step, state);
    case "changeStep":
      return onStep.set(action.step, state);
    case "reset":
      return initialCounter;
  }
};

const MyCounterComponent = () => {
  const [counter, dispatch] = useOpticReducer(onCounter, reducer);

  useEffect(() => {
    dispatch({ type: "increment" });
    dispatch({ type: "changeStep", step: 10 });
    dispatch({ type: "increment" });
    dispatch({ type: "changeStep", step: 3 });
    dispatch({ type: "decrement" });
    // counter.value will be 8
  }, [dispatch]);

  // ...
};
```
