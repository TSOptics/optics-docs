title: DataOptic
---

Optics make working with immutable state painless, but sometimes you may need to perform these immutable updates outside of global state created with [`createState`](../API/createState.md).  
Examples range from updating React state created with `useState`,
updating global state in a [Redux reducer](https://redux.js.org/faq/immutable-data#why-is-immutability-required-by-redux)
or a [Zustand action](https://docs.pmnd.rs/zustand/guides/immutable-state-and-merging),
to manipulating your GraphQL cache directly [with apollo-client](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/caching/cache-interaction/).

A **`DataOptic`** is an Optic that's not focused on global state, but simply on a plain immutable value that you want to **produce new versions of**.  
It retains all of the benefits of the Optics API but without the state management part (no `subscribe` method).

## Usage

Call the [`focusOn`](../API/focusOn.mdx) function to create a **DataOptic** from a plain value.

```twoslash include main
import { focusOn } from "@optics/react";

const user = {
  name: "John Doe",
  contact: {
    mail: "foo@bar.com",
    address: {
      number: 1,
      street: "Rue de la paix",
    },
  },
  credits: {
    gold: { available: 10, blocked: 3 },
    silver: { available: 30, blocked: 7 },
  },
};

const userOptic = focusOn(user);
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
```

<br />

- Call `set` everytime you want to apply a modification where the optic is currently focused.  
  It returns a new `DataOptic` focused on the updated value.
- Call `get` to retrieve the final value that got all the previous updates applied to it.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
const updatedUser = focusOn(user)
  .contact.address.number.set(10)
  .credits.gold.available.set((prev) => prev + 5)
  .get();
```

It lets us update both the user's street number and his amount of available gold credits **in a single expression**.

```ts {6, 11}
// updatedUser
{
  name: "Vincent",
  contact: {
    mails: "foo@bar.com",
    address: {
      number: 10,
      street: "Rue de la paix",
    },
  },
  credits: {
    gold: { available: 15, blocked: 3 },
    silver: { available: 30, blocked: 7 },
  },
};
```

## @optics/data

The [`@optics/data`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@optics/data) package only exports `DataOptic` and the [`focusOn`](../API/focusOn.mdx) function, without the rest of the API related to state management.  
You can import this package if you are already invested in another state management solution and just want to use Optics to perform immutable updates.
