title: Lists
---

With an optic focused on an array, it's often useful to **derive an optic for each element of the array** (e.g. to loop over these optics and render a list from it).

`useOptic` returns the [`getOptics`](../API/React/useOptic.mdx#--getoptics) function that lets you do exactly that:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  id: string;
};

declare const User: ({
  userOptic,
}: {
  userOptic: Optic<User>;
}) => React.ReactElement;

// ---cut---
import { useOptic } from "@optics/react";

type Props = {
  usersOptic: Optic<User[]>;
};

const Users = ({ usersOptic }: Props) => {
  const [, { getOptics }] = useOptic(usersOptic);

  const optics = getOptics((user) => user.id);

  return optics.map(([key, userOptic]) => (
    <User key={key} userOptic={userOptic} />
  ));
};
```

:::info Keys
The function you pass to `getOptics` is used to compute a key for each element in the array.  
This is used to prevent the optics from being recreated when the array is modified. When an
element changes place in the array, the optic focused on this element is reused and doesn't change reference.

Keys for optics serve pretty much the same purpose as [keys in React](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key).  
In fact you can reuse the the generated key and pass it to the `key` prop of the component you render just like we did in the example above.

#### Mapped Optics

The [`getOpticsFromMapping`](../API/React/useOptic.mdx#--getopticsfrommapping) function does the same thing but for [mapped optics](./map_reduce.mdx).

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  id: string;
};

declare const User: ({
  userOptic,
}: {
  userOptic: Optic<User>;
}) => React.ReactElement;

// ---cut---
import { useOptic, mapped } from "@optics/react";

type Props = {
  userMappedOptic: Optic<User, mapped>;
};

const Users = ({ userMappedOptic }: Props) => {
  const [, { getOpticsFromMapping }] = useOptic(userMappedOptic);

  const optics = getOpticsFromMapping((user) => user.id);

  return optics.map(([key, userOptic]) => (
    <User key={key} userOptic={userOptic} />
  ));
};
```
