title: Lists

With an optic focused on an array, it's often useful to **derive an optic for each element of the array** (e.g. to loop over these optics and render a list from it).

You can do that with the **`For`** component.  
It takes an optic focused on an array, a `getKey` function,
and a render function that will be called for each element with an optic focused on it:

```tsx twoslash
import React from "react";
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  id: string;
};

declare const User: ({
  userOptic,
}: {
  userOptic: Optic<User>;
}) => React.ReactElement;

// ---cut---
import { For } from "@optics/react";

type Props = {
  usersOptic: Optic<User[]>;
};

const Users = ({ usersOptic }: Props) => (
  <For optic={usersOptic} getKey={(user) => user.id}>
    {(userOptic) => <User userOptic={userOptic} />}
  </For>
);
```

:::tip
The component calling `For` doesn't need to subscribe itself to the optic.

:::info Keys
The `getKey` function is used to compute a key for each element in the array.  
This is used to prevent the optics from being recreated when the array is modified. When an
element changes place in the array, the optic focused on this element is reused and doesn't change reference.

Keys for optics serve the same purpose as [keys in React](https://react.dev/learn/rendering-lists#keeping-list-items-in-order-with-key),
in fact the `For` component injects these same keys in the React elements it renders, so you don't have to it yourself.

### useDeriveOptics

`For` is simply a memo-ed component that internally calls the `useDeriveOptics` hook.  
You can use this hook directly, in case you want to derive an array of optics for something else than rendering a list of components.

```ts twoslash
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  id: string;
};
declare const usersOptic: Optic<User[]>;
// ---cut---
import { useDeriveOptics } from "@optics/react";

const optics = useDeriveOptics(usersOptic, (user) => user.id);
//    ^?
```
