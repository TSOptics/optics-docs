# Core Concepts

As explained in the previous section it is useful to think of optics as references.  
In fact in Haskell, where the concept originated, they are often called **functional references**.
They point to parts of your application's immutable state and let you interact with it.  
This parallel is useful to grasp the core concepts of optics because just like references:

- they can be **broken down** into smaller parts by calling properties of the object they point to.
- they can reference other optics and, in doing so, represent **relations** between your different states.
- they can be passed around in your application, to your functions and components.

## Decompose

We already saw that we can decompose, or break down, an optic into smaller parts by calling properties of the object they point to.

```twoslash include main
import { createState } from "@optics/react";

const onUsers = createState([
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 42,
    address: { city: "New York", street: { name: "5th Avenue", number: 940 } },
  },
]);
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---

const onJeanneAge = onUsers[1].age;
//    ^?
```

We access the index `1` of the root optic and then the `age` property, getting us a new optic focused on a narrower part of the initial state.  
It's what we call **top-down decomposition**, we start at the top from a root optic at and we break it down into its sub-parts as we go down the tree.

Now we can read and update this number **independently of the surrounding state**.
In fact we don't have to care if there's a surrounding state at all or if it's an optic direclty returned by `createState`. Only what's currently focused matters.

:::info
When deriving an optic in a component body it's better to wrap with in `useMemo` to avoid recreating a new reference at every render.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
import { useMemo } from "react";
// ---cut---

const onJeanneAge = useMemo(() => onUsers[1].age, [onUsers]);
```

:::

It also greatly simplifies immutable updates:
instead of having to shallow copy every level up to the one that interests us (the dreaded _spread operator pyramid of doom_)
we just have to **focus on the specific part** we want to update and call `set` on it.

Once we update the underlying value, the subscribers (usually components) will be notified, whether they subscribed to the `onJeanneAge` optic or any other optic whose value would have changed due to the update.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const onJeanneAge = onUsers[1].age;
// ---cut---

onUsers.subscribe(() => console.log("users informations were updated")); // ✅
onUsers[0].subscribe(() => console.log("John's informations were updated")); // ❌
onUsers[1].subscribe(() => console.log("Jeanne's informations were updated")); // ✅
onJeanneAge.subscribe((age) =>
  console.log(`Jeanne's age was updated to ${age}`)
); // ✅

onJeanneAge.set(33);
```

Console output:

```
- users informations were updated
- Jeanne's informations were updated
- Jeanne's age was updated to 33
```

John's subscriber was not notified because the former doesn't know about Jeanne or her age.

:::caution
Don't use destructuring to derive new optics.  
They use proxies under the hood to return new optics from properties so the following won't work:

```ts
const { age, name } = onJeanne;
```

:::

#### Methods

Calling a property is not the only way to decompose an optic, just like references you can call methods on them.
It's a way to derive new optics not from a property but from a condition, a transformation, ...

For example if we want to focus on the oldest user:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const onJeanneAge = onUsers[1].age;
// ---cut---

const onOldestUser = onUsers.max((user) => user.age);

onOldestUser.get(); // { name: "John", age: 42, address: { ... } }

onJeanneAge.set(80);

onOldestUser.get(); // { name: "Jeanne", age: 80, address: { ... } }
```

Here `onOldestUser` will always point to the oldest user, so when we age poor Jeanne by 47 years, she becomes the oldest user and the optic points to her now.

While `max` is only available when the focused type is an array, some methods are available to every optic.

One such method is [`convert`](<../API/Methods/convert()>). It lets you perform a lossless conversion from the focused type to another.  
For example if we wanted to manipulate the user's street as a tuple instead of an object:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const onJeanne = onUsers[1];
// ---cut---

const onJeanneStreetTuple = onJeanne.address.street.convert(
  ({ name, number }) => [name, number] as const,
  ([name, number]) => ({ name, number })
);
```

Here we passed two functions to `convert`: one to transform the street object into a tuple, and a second one that does the reverse transformation (from tuple to object).  
Now we can manipulate the street as a tuple even though it is still represented as an object in the state.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const onJeanne = onUsers[1];
const onJeanneStreetTuple = onJeanne.address.street.convert(
  ({ name, number }) => [name, number] as const,
  ([name, number]) => ({ name, number })
);

// ---cut---

onJeanneStreetTuple.set(([name, number]) => [name, number + 10]);

onJeanneStreetTuple.get(); // ["Rue de Rivoli", 11]

onJeanne.address.street.get(); // { name: "Rue de Rivoli", number: 11 }
```

You can check all the methods available to optics like [`min`](<../API/methods/array/min()>), [`max`](<../API/methods/array/max()>), [`refine`](<../API/Methods/refine()>) or [`convert`](<../API/Methods/convert()>) under the API section of this site.

## Compose

We just saw that we can decompose optics (top-down) but we actually can also do the opposite,
meaning we can create new optics by composing already existing optics together (**bottom-up composition**).

To illustrate let's create a new organization with a name, and a list of employees:

```twoslash include Interpol
import { createState, Optic } from "@optics/react";

let onUsers: Optic<
  {
    name: string;
    age: number;
    address: { city: string; street: { name: string; number: number } };
  }[]
> = {} as any;
const onJohn = onUsers[0];
const onJeanne = onUsers[1];

const onInterpol = createState({
  name: "Interpol",
  established: "1923",
  employees: [onJeanne, onJohn],
});
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const onJohn = onUsers[0];
const onJeanne = onUsers[1];

// ---cut---

const onInterpol = createState({
  name: "Interpol",
  established: "1923",
  employees: [onJeanne, onJohn],
});
```

As you can see the employees we passed are not actual javascript objects but optics we created earlier.

When we call `get` on interpol's optic it automatically **denormalizes** the result and replaces the optics by their respective state:

```ts twoslash
// @include: Interpol
// ---cut---
const interpol = onInterpol.get();
// {
//   name: "Interpol",
//   established: "1923",
//   employees: [
//     { name: "Jeanne", age: 80, address: { ... } },
//     { name: "John", age: 42, address: { ... } },
//   ],
// }
```

We have created a new state which is the composition of its own state and references to those of our two previous users.

If we update the state of one of the employees then it's like if the organization state was updated as well
so its subscribers will be notified (will re-render if they are components).

To illustrate let's give back Jeanne her youth:

```ts twoslash
// @include: Interpol
const onJeanneAge = onJeanne.age;
// ---cut---
onInterpol.employees.subscribe((employees) =>
  console.log(`one of the ${employees.length} employees was updated`)
);

onJeanneAge.set(32);
```

Console output:

```
one of the 2 employees was updated
```

Using optics in the state of an entity is a way to create **relations** between your different states.  
In a relational database we use foreign keys to represent relations between tables, here optics are used for the same purpose.
In SQL we use **joins** to get the final denormalized result, with optics it is done automatically.

<details>
  <summary>Opt-out of denormalization</summary>
  You can choose to get the normalized result instead, by setting the denormalize
  option to <code>false</code> when calling <code>get</code>:<br />

```ts twoslash
// @include: Interpol
// ---cut---
const result = onInterpol.get({ denormalize: false });
```

The type of the returned value will of course change depending on the value of `denormalize`:

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th width="700px">
denormalize: false
</th>
<th width="700px">
denormalize: true (default)
</th>
</tr>
</thead>
  <tr>
    <td>

```ts twoslash
// @include: Interpol
const result = onInterpol.get({ denormalize: false });
// ---cut---

result;
//    ^?
```

</td>
<td>

```ts twoslash
// @include: Interpol
const denormalizedResult = onInterpol.get();

// ---cut---

denormalizedResult;
//    ^?
```

</td>
</tr>
</table>
</details>

#### State graph

The organization has a reference to its employees but in turn indivual employee can also have references to other entities.  
First let's make cities a first-class citizen in our state:

```twoslash include cities
import { createState } from "@optics/react";

const onParis = createState({ name: "Paris", inhabitants: 2_200_000 });
const onMilan = createState({ name: "Milan", inhabitants: 1_400_000 });
const onNewYork = createState({ name: "New York", inhabitants: 8_500_000 });
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: cities
```

Then we can rework our initial state. Instead of representing a user's city with a string let's use an optic to reference a previously created city:

```ts twoslash
// @include: cities
// ---cut---

const onUsers = createState([
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 42,
    address: { city: onNewYork },
  },
  {
    name: "Jeanne",
    age: 32,
    address: { city: onParis },
  },
]);
```

Now the fully denormalized result from `onInterpol` looks like that:

```ts twoslash
// @include: cities
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
const onJohn = createState({
  name: "John",
  age: 42,
  address: { city: onNewYork },
});
const onInterpol = createState({
  name: "Interpol",
  established: "1923",
  employees: [onJohn],
});

// ---cut---

const interpol = onInterpol.get();

// {
//   name: "Interpol",
//   established: "1923",
//   employees: [
//     {
//       name: "John",
//       age: 42,
//       address: {
//         city: {
//           name: "New York",
//           inhabitants: 8_500_000,
//         },
//       },
//     },
//     {
//       name: "Jeanne",
//       age: 32,
//       address: {
//         city: {
//           name: "Paris",
//           inhabitants: 2_200_000,
//         },
//       },
//     },
//   ],
// }
```

As you can see denormalization is recursive, meaning that if a referenced entity has references of its own, they will be denormalized as well.

You can update a relation by simply replacing the optic with another one.  
For example if Jeanne moves to Milan:

```ts twoslash
// @include: cities
const onUsers = createState([
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 42,
    address: { city: onNewYork },
  },
]);

// ---cut---

onUsers[1].address.city.set(onMilan);
```

Referencing other entities with optics allows us to represent our state as a **graph**,
where the **nodes** are the entities we build with `createState` and the **edges** are the optics we put in the state to make the relations.

While immutable state is great it however makes it hard to represent such graphs.  
We usually have to resort to representing the relation with the the id of the target entity and then doing what's essentially a manual join to get our denormalized result.  
Optics makes the whole process **automatic**, **reactive** and **type-safe**, which is fundamental for applications with non trivial client state,
as most of them eventually need to represent relations between entities.

:::caution cycles
We need our graph to be **acyclic** to avoid infinite loops when denormalizing.  
That means you can't have both the user referencing the city and the city referencing the user, one of them must exclusively **own** the relation. <sub><sup><i>(I guess my ex was just mindful of graph cycles)</i></sup></sub>

In general it's better to abstain from making the graph overly complex as it can make it easy to accidently introduce cycles,
as well as making denormalization slow (just like too many joins in SQL can degrade performance).
:::

## Decouple

Another pattern that optics encourages is **decoupling** your global state from your components.

It can be hard to do when dealing with external state because you might be inclined to import it directly in your components.

To illustrate let's use a fictitious `useStore` hook implementing the commonly used pattern of selecting a part of the store from the root and subscribing to it:

```tsx
import { useStore } from "./myStore";

const User = () => {
  const user = useStore((state) => state.users[0]);
};
```

Here, as noted by the import of the store at line 1, we **coupled** our component to the store.  
The `User` component will get the user from the same store, using the same path every time.
We can't **reuse the component** to render any another user.

Coupling hurts reusability but also **testability**: we can't easily render the component in isolation (inside a Storybook, a unit test, ...)
since we need to carry with us the surrounding context that the selector needs to get the data.

And that's where lies the problem, **the component shouldn't have to know the shape of the global state**.  
Its only job should be rendering a user, no matter where it comes from.

:::info
We could split our component into _smart_ and _dumb_ ones (or _container_ and _presentational_) to keep the dumb component decoupled from the state,
but at the cost of additional verbosity and nesting in the component tree.
:::

That's where optics come in, as they allow us to naturally decouple our components from the global state simply by passing them to the component's props:

```tsx twoslash
import { Optic, useOptic } from "@optics/react";
// @include: cities
type User = { name: string; age: number; address: { city: typeof onParis } };

// ---cut---

interface UserProps {
  onUser: Optic<User>;
}

const User = ({ onUser }: UserProps) => {
  const [user, setUser] = useOptic(onUser);
};
```

Now the User component can be passed **any optic** focused on a user, allowing you to **reuse it** anywhere in your application.

```tsx
<User onUser={onJeanne} />
<User onUser={onJohn} />
```

When testing you can create a new throwaway user just for your test needs, without having to worry about the rest of the global state:

```tsx
import { render } from "@testing-library/*";

test("User renders a user", () => {
  const onTestUser = createState({ name: "Vincent", age: 29, address: { ... } });

  render(<User onUser={onTestUser} />);
});
```

Listing dependencies in the props is always recommended to avoid coupling and there's no reason that it should be otherwise for global state !

#### Roots and leaves

Of course not all components can get their optics through their props as we have to start somewhere with some initial optics.
For example the `UserList` component is **close to the root** and imports the `onUsers` optic directly:

```tsx twoslash
// @module: esnext
// @filename: users.ts
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";
export type User = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
  address: {
    city: Optic<{
      name: string;
      inhabitants: number;
    }>;
  };
};

export const onUsers = {} as Optic<User[]>;

// @filename: UserList.tsx
// @module: esnext
import { User } from "./users";
import React, { FC } from "react";
import { Optic, useOptic } from "@optics/react";
const User = {} as FC<{ onUser: Optic<User> }>;
// ---cut---
import { onUsers } from "./users";

const UserList = () => {
  const [users, setUsers] = useOptic(onUsers);

  return (
    <ul>
      {users.map((user, index) => (
        <li key={user.name}>
          <User onUser={onUsers[index]} />
        </li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
};
```

But now that we have this optic the component can derive new optics for each user and pass them down to the `User` component, which if you remember takes one through a `onUser` prop.  
In turn the `User` component itself derives from its optic a new one focused on the user's street and pass it down to a `StreetForm` component, etc ...

That way once a root component has imported an optic, **most components below it** can get their optics through their props and **stay decoupled from the global state**, letting you reuse them elsewhere, test them, render them in stories, etc.

## Conclusion

Now that you've learned how to **decompose**, **compose** your state, and **decouple** your components from it,
you know every important concept there is to know about state management with optics.

To further your knowledge you can go through the following guides:

- [total and partial](../Guides/total_partial): understand how a total optic will always yield a value while it might not be the case for a partial one.
- [Map/Reduce](../Guides/map_reduce): learn how to focus multiple values at a time, and then how to **reduce** the focus back a single value.
- [Forms](../Guides/forms): learn how to build performant and scalable forms by controlling your inputs with optics.
