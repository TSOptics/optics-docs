# Getting Started

**Optics** is a library to manage global immutable state in TypeScript applications.

It let's you declare **references** to parts of your state, called **optics**, that allow you to **read** and **update** these parts as well as **subscribe** to their changes.  
Optics are compositional in nature, making them a natural fit for component based UI frameworks.

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @optics/react
```

(Requires React 18+)

<details>
  <summary>Other frameworks</summary>

Adapters for different UI frameworks are planned as well.  
In the meantime you can also use the framework agnostic version of the library:

```bash
npm install @optics/state
```

</details>

This library has been built with TypeScript's type inference in mind, using it in strict mode is strongly recommended.

## Usage

To create a global state call the `createState` function and pass it an initial value:

```twoslash include main
import { createState } from "@optics/react";

const usersOptic = createState([
  {
    name: "John",
    age: 42,
    address: { city: "New York", street: { name: "5th Avenue", number: 940 } },
  },
]);
```

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
```

It returns us an **optic**:
a **reference** to a piece of application state that allows us to read, update this state as well as subscribe to it.

Read the state with `get`:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
usersOptic.get(); // [{ name: "John", age: 42, address: { ... } }]
```

Update it with `set`:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
// adds a new user
usersOptic.set((prev) => [
  ...prev,
  {
    name: "Jeanne",
    age: 32,
    address: { city: "Paris", street: { name: "Rue de Rivoli", number: 1 } },
  },
]);

usersOptic.get(); // [{ name: "John", age: 42, address: { ... } }, { name: "Jeanne", age: 32, address: { ... } }]
```

Subscribe to it with `subscribe`:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---

usersOptic.subscribe((users) => {
  console.log("users changed: ", users);
});
```

:::tip
You're not restricted to a single global state, you can call `createState` as many times as you want.

### Deriving new optics

Where it gets interesting is that, from this base optic, you can get new ones focused on different parts of your state !

For exemple let's get an optic that focuses on the city of the first user in our list:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---

const cityOptic = usersOptic[0].address.city;
//    ^?
```

Now we can directly read and update the city of the first user with this optic:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const cityOptic = usersOptic[0].address.city;
// ---cut---
cityOptic.get(); // "New York"

cityOptic.set("Boston");

cityOptic.get(); // "Boston"
```

<details>
  <summary>
    Let's compare that with the manual way of updating immutable data:
  </summary>

```ts
// üòµ‚Äçüí´
const newState = [
  {
    ...users[0],
    address: {
      ...users[0].address,
      city: "Boston",
    },
  },
  ...users.slice(1),
];
```

Using optics saves us from quite the boilerplate when updating deeply nested data !

</details>

Optics let you focus on **narrower parts of your state**, allowing you to read and update these parts independently of the rest.

Another example:

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
// ---cut---
const jeanneStreetOptic = usersOptic[1].address.street;
//    ^?

jeanneStreetOptic.number.set(42);

jeanneStreetOptic.get(); // { name: "Rue de Rivoli", number: 42 }
```

:::tip
Deriving a new optic looks just like accessing properties of an object !  
You get the same **type-safety** and **code completion** in your editor as with plain javascript objects.

:::info
For now don't worry about the `total` type parameter, you'll be able to learn about that later in the [total and partial](../../Guides/total_partial) section of the docs.

### Usage in components

Your React components can subscribe to optics and re-render when the focused states change.

Call the `useOptic` hook with an optic, it returns the current value inside a tuple.

```tsx twoslash
// @include: main

const jeanneStreetOptic = usersOptic[1].address.street;
// ---cut---
import { useOptic } from "@optics/react";

const StreetForm = () => {
  const [street] = useOptic(jeanneStreetOptic);

  return (
    <div>
      <input
        value={street.number}
        type="number"
        onChange={(e) => jeanneStreetOptic.number.set(parseInt(e.target.value))}
      />
      {street.name}
    </div>
  );
};
```

<br />

The component will re-render when the street changes, whether it is changed from within the component or from elsewhere in the application.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const jeanneStreetOptic = usersOptic[1].address.street;
// ---cut---

// outside of the component
jeanneStreetOptic.number.set((prev) => prev + 1);

// StreetForm re-renders üîÑ
```

However the component will not re-render if an unrelated part of the state changes.

```ts twoslash
// @include: main
const jeanneOptic = usersOptic[1];
// ---cut---

jeanneOptic.age.set((prev) => prev + 1);

// Jeanne's street reference hasn't changed, StreetForm doesn't re-render üö´
```

### Pass optics in props

Instead of referencing the optic directly, the component can accept one **via its props**.

```tsx twoslash
import { useOptic, Optic } from "@optics/react";

interface Props {
  streetOptic: Optic<{ name: string; number: number }>;
}

const StreetForm = ({ streetOptic }: Props) => {
  const [street] = useOptic(streetOptic);
  // ...
};
```

Now `StreetForm` isn't **coupled** to a specific part of the state anymore, it can take **any optic** that's focused on a street.

```tsx twoslash
// @include: main
import { Optic } from "@optics/react";

interface Props {
  streetOptic: Optic<{ name: string; number: number }>;
}

const StreetForm = ({ streetOptic }: Props) => {
  return (<></>) as React.JSX.Element;
};

// ---cut---
<>
  {/* Form for john's street */}
  <StreetForm streetOptic={usersOptic[0].address.street} />

  {/* Form for Jeanne's street */}
  <StreetForm streetOptic={usersOptic[1].address.street} />
</>;
```

## Next steps

Now that you know the basics of optics you can go through the [**core concepts**](../core-concepts) to have a better grasp of the notions introduced here and learn about optic composition.
