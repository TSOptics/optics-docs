# Getting Started

**react-optics** is a state management library for React that uses structures called **optics** to focus on slices of your store.  
Optics make reading and updating these slices easy. You can **compose** optics to go deeper in your store !

**react-optics** is lightweight (> 2kB), unopinionated, typesafe and strives to feel like a natural extension of React.

## Requirements

react-optics requires **React** `16.3` or higher.

**TypeScript** is optional but strongly recommended (version `4.1` or higher, strict mode).

## Installation

```bash npm2yarn
npm install react-optics
```

## Basic example

No state management documentation is truly complete without a simple counter as an example, so let's get started:

### Creating the store

The first step is to create a store by calling `createStore` and passing it an initial value.  
It returns an **optic** focusing on the store.

```tsx
import { createStore } from 'react-optics';

const onState = createStore({
    counters: {
        counterA: { value: 0, step: 1 },
        counterB: { value: 0, step: 2 }
    }
});
```

Here the optic `onState` focuses on the root of your store.

### Focusing

To get the optic focusing on the value in counterA, call `focus` on the optic `onState` with the right path.  
Let the **code completion** guide you !

<MdxImage src="path-completion-light.png" srcDark="path-completion-dark.png" />

### Using the optic in a component

Just call the hook `useOptic` with your optic ! It returns the focused value and a setter just like React's `useState`.

```tsx title=Counter.tsx
import { useOptic } from 'react-optics';

const Counter = () => {
    const [counterValue, setCounterValue] = useOptic(onValueA);

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setCounterValue((prev) => prev + 1)}>
                increment
            </button>
            {counterValue}
            <button onClick={() => setCounterValue((prev) => prev - 1)}>
                decrement
            </button>
        </div>
    );
};
```

<Counter />

#

The setter returned by `useOptic` allows you to change `counterValue`
just like it was local state, you don't need to worry that it's part of a complex
store object.

And that's it !

### Optics as props

Don't we also have a counterB in our store ?  
Let's change things up and make our component `Counter` take an optic as a prop instead of directly referencing `onValueA`.

```tsx title=Counter.tsx
import { useOptic } from "react-optics";

const Counter = ({ onCounterValue }) => {
  const [counterValue, setCounterValue] = useOptic(onCounterValue);

  ...
};
```

Now we can call two instances of `Counter`, each with its own optic, focusing on its own part of the state.

```tsx title=Counters.tsx {3-4,11-12}
import { useOptic } from "react-optics";

const onValueA = onState.focus("counters.counterA.value");
const onValueB = onState.focus("counters.counterB.value");

const Counters = () => {
  const [counters] = useOptic(onState.focus("counters"));
  return (
    ...
      sum = {counters.counterA.value + counters.counterB.value}
      <Counter onCounterValue={onValueA} />
      <Counter onCounterValue={onValueB} />
    ...
  );
};
```

<Counters />

## Bonus

In our store we also defined a `step` attribute for both counters.
To access it in our component let's change some things.  
Instead of passing to our `Counter` component an optic focusing on the value let's take a step back and focus on the complete counter instead. We will then focus on the value and the step separately in the component.

```tsx file=Counter.tsx {4-5,12-16}
import { useOptic } from 'react-optics';

const Counter = ({ onCounter }) => {
    const [value, setValue] = useOptic(onCounter.focus('value'));
    const [step, setStep] = useOptic(onCounter.focus('step'));

    return (
        <div>
            <button onClick={() => setValue((prev) => prev + step)}>
                increment
            </button>
            {value}
            <button onClick={() => setValue((prev) => prev - step)}>
                decrement
            </button>
            <input
                type="number"
                value={step}
                onChange={(event) => setStep(event.target.valueAsNumber)}
            />
        </div>
    );
};
```

```tsx file=Counters.tsx {3-4,11-12}
import { useOptic } from "react-optics";

const onCounterA = onState.focus("counters.counterA");
const onCounterB = onState.focus("counters.counterB");

const Counters = () => {
  const [counters] = useOptic(onState.focus("counters"));
  return (
    ...
      sum: {counters.counterA.value + counters.counterB.value}
      <Counter onCounter={onCounterA} />
      <Counter onCounter={onCounterB} />
    ...
  );
};
```

<CountersWithStep />

As you can see optics are very flexible, you can compose them in many ways.  
Passing them down your components hierarchy as props works very well. It feels just like passing down properties of a plain js object but instead it's a global reactive store !

#

:::tip
In the this example the next value is computed from two pieces of state (the previous value and step).  
If you are thinking **reducer** you'd be right !
