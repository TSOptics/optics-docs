# Motivation

- why immutability is important in React
- why it is hard in javascript
- why the alternative sucks (normalizing, immer ?)
- the power of state tree
- how functional programming already solved the problem
- how optics unlock this power for immutable structures
- how react-optix brings the concept to react thanks to typescript, hooks, an idiomatic js api and previous art on react state management.
