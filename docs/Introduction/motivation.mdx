# Motivation

In react a component is a piece of ui, logic and state that defines its contract via its props. It is this contract that makes them composable and give React its power.

-   why immutability is important in React
-   why it is hard in javascript
-   why the alternative sucks (normalizing, immer ?)
-   the power of state tree
-   how functional programming already solved the problem
-   how optics unlock this power for immutable structures
-   how react-optics brings the concept to react thanks to typescript, hooks, an idiomatic js api and previous art on react state management.

In React hoisting your state up in a single place (store or context) is a common practice to share state across your app.
It allows us to access global state from anywhere in the app
However such practice comes with signiificant drawbacks and clash with react's principles.
